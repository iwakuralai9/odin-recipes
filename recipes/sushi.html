<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish made from seasoned rice combined with a variety of ingredients such as raw fish, vegetables, and seaweed. It's a delicious and healthy option for a light meal or snack.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1/3 cup rice vinegar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
    <li>Sushi-grade fish (such as tuna, salmon, or yellowtail), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Vegetables (such as cucumber, avocado, or carrot), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Soy sauce, for serving</li>
    <li>Wasabi, for serving</li>
    <li>Pickled ginger, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture using a rice paddle or spatula. Be careful not to smash the rice grains.</li>
    <li>Place a sheet of nori seaweed on a bamboo sushi mat or clean kitchen towel, shiny side down.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.</li>
    <li>Arrange your desired fillings (fish, vegetables, etc.) in a line across the center of the rice.</li>
    <li>Starting from the bottom, tightly roll the sushi using the bamboo mat or towel, pressing gently to seal the edge.</li>
    <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.</li>
    <li>Serve the sushi with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side. Enjoy!</li>
